# passGenerator

In this project will make a passward generator using Javascript

Html page: 
- Added an onclick to the Generate Password button and I linked it to the function that will do all the work in JS.

CSS page: 
- Only Changed the text-align in the passward text area to left instead of the center.

JS page:
- Created 2 functions the fist one included all the scenarios for the passward requested, and the second function is to check that passward criteria has been selected and print the resulet based on it.
